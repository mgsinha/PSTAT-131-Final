## Overview of Data Set

<br> 

We are analyzing the quality of wine based on 11 predictors: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulfates, alcohol. Quality, in this instance, is defined as an indicator of its craftsmanship and, thus, desirability which can be used, for example, in pricing. Quality does not necessarily indicate if a wine has gone bad. We will use two data sets -- one for white wine and the other for red -- to create two respective machine learning models. There are 4899 observations in the white wine data set and 1600 observations in the red wine data set. 


## Overview of Research Questions 

<br>

We are interested in conducting analysis on both the white and red wine to assess the quality of wine in new wines in production so that they may be accurately priced and marketed.  


# Loading Data  
This project uses data on the white and red wine, which records information about the details of the wine. 

```{r load data, message = FALSE}

white_og <- read.csv("Wine Dataset/winequality-white.csv", sep = ";")
red_og <- read.csv("Wine Dataset/winequality-red.csv", sep = ";")
```


# Data Cleaning 

To clean our data, we clean the column names, change quality into a factor so we can analyze it with classification models, and add the type "White" or "Red" to each data set. We removed any rows with a quality value of 9 because there are too few instances, and thus, it inhibits our models from performing correctly later on. We also create a combined data frame with both values from white and red wine to see if there are significant differences between red and white evaluations for quality.  

```{r data cleaning}
# Make Column Names Clean 
white_og %>% clean_names()
red_og %>% clean_names()

#take out data with quality = 9; red does not have any values of 9
white <- white_og[white_og$quality < 9,]
red <- red_og[red_og$quality < 9,]

# Change quality to factor
white$quality <- factor(white$quality, levels = c(3,4,5,6,7,8))
red$quality <- factor(red$quality, levels = c(3,4,5,6,7,8))

# Adding type
white$type <- "White"
red$type <- "Red"

# data frame of combined wine
combinedWine_og <- rbind(white_og, red_og)
combinedWine <- rbind(white, red)
```

# Data Split

In our data split, we put a proportion of .7 of each original data set into a training data set and a proportion of .3 into the testing data sets, stratifying by quality. In this section, we also folded our data into 5 folds for later cross validation use.

```{r data split, message = FALSE}
white_split <- white %>% 
  initial_split(prop = 0.7, strata = "quality")

white_train <- training(white_split)
white_test <- testing(white_split)

red_split <- red %>% 
  initial_split(prop = 0.7, strata = "quality")

red_train <- training(red_split)
red_test <- testing(red_split)

white_fold <- vfold_cv(white_train, v = 5)
red_fold <- vfold_cv(red_train, v = 5)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

What sort of factors do winemakers and sommeliers look for in a quality wine? Generally, quality is determined by acidity, dryness, flavor profile or taste, alcohol content, and how well the wine is preserved or how it changes as it is stored. In our exploratory data analysis, we will analyze our predictors based on these five categories. First, acidity levels can be summarized through the pH levels, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, and citric acid content. Dryness is determined by the density. Taste can be broken down into sweetness and saltiness, which are caused by residual sugar and chlorides respectively. We will analyze alcohol content singularly to see its effect on the wine quality. Lastly, sulfurous compounds are what is generally used to preserve wine, so we will analyze free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, and sulfates to see if the way a wine is preserved interacts with wine quality in an interesting way.

Our data can be split into two datasets because experts look for different levels of acidity, sugar, etc. for white wine and red wine. Thus, we will have 3 different representations of the data: one for white wine, one for red wine, and one for both. 

All of our predictors are continuous, so we will use box plots, histograms, and scatter plots to visualize our data and determine feature selection.

First, let's see the distribution of quality between both data sets of wine. 
 
```{r combined quality histogram}
ggplot(combinedWine_og, aes(quality)) + geom_bar(color = "black", fill = "pink") + labs(title = "Histogram of Quality - Total Wine") + xlab("Quality of Wine") + ylab("Count") 
```

We can see that it is normally distributed, meaning that most wine has a quality value of 5 or 6, with few exceptionally good wines having a value of 8 or 9, and low quality wines having a quality value of 3. 

Next, we look at the correlation matrices for white and red wine separately to determine which predictors are correlated and thus, which predictors we need to interact in our modelling recipes. 

```{r correlation matrix}
white %>% 
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  corrplot(type = 'lower', diag = FALSE, 
           method = 'color', main = 'White Wine Correlation Plot')

red %>% 
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  corrplot(type = 'lower', diag = FALSE, 
           method = 'color', main = 'Red Wine Correlation Plot')
```

In the white wine correlation matrix, density and residual sugar; and density and alcohol are the predictors with the highest correlation. We will also plot total sulfur dioxide and free sulfur dioxide which has a moderate correlation.

In the red wine correlation matrix, citric acid and fixed acidity; density and fixed acidity; citric acid and volatile acidity; pH and fixed acidity; and free sulfur dioxide and total sulfur dioxide are highly correlated with each other.  

To visualize and validate these correlations, let's take a look at the scaled scatter plot of each.

```{r white wine scatter plots, message=FALSE}

# scaled datasets 
scaled_white = as.data.frame(scale(select(white, c(-quality,-type))))
scaled_red = as.data.frame(scale(select(red, c(-quality,-type))))

# scaled white residual sugar versus density 
wrsd = ggplot(scaled_white, aes(x = residual.sugar, y = density)) + geom_point()+scale_x_continuous(name = "Residual Sugar") + scale_y_continuous(name = "Density") + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+ ggtitle(" Residual Sugar Versus Density") + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 5))

# scaled white alcohol versus density 
wad = ggplot(scaled_white, aes(x = alcohol, y = density)) + geom_point()+scale_x_continuous(name = "Alcohol") + scale_y_continuous(name = "Density") + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+ ggtitle("Alcohol Versus Density") + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 5))

# scaled white free sulfur dioxide versus total sulfur dioxide
wfsdtsd = ggplot(scaled_white, aes(x = free.sulfur.dioxide, y = total.sulfur.dioxide)) + geom_point()+scale_x_continuous(name = "Free Sulfur Dioxide") + scale_y_continuous(name = "Total Sulfur Dioxide") + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+ ggtitle("Free Sulfur Versus Total Sulfur Dioxide") + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 5))

ggarrange(wrsd, wad, wfsdtsd + rremove("x.text"), ncol = 3, nrow = 1) %>% annotate_figure(top = text_grob("White Wine Scaled"))
```

```{r red wine scatter plots}
# scaled red volatile acidity versus citric acid
rvaca = ggplot(scaled_red, aes(x = volatile.acidity, y = citric.acid)) + geom_point()+scale_x_continuous(name = "Volatile Acidity") + scale_y_continuous(name = "Citric Acid") + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+ ggtitle("Volatile Acidity Versus Citric Acid") + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 5))

# scaled red fixed acidity versus citric acid 
rfaca = ggplot(scaled_red, aes(x = fixed.acidity, y = citric.acid)) + geom_point()+scale_x_continuous(name = "Fixed Acidity") + scale_y_continuous(name = "Citric Acid") + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+ ggtitle("Fixed Acidity Versus Citric Acid") + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 5))

# scaled red fixed acidity versus pH
rfap = ggplot(scaled_red, aes(x = fixed.acidity, y = pH)) + geom_point()+scale_x_continuous(name = "Fixed Acidity") + scale_y_continuous(name = "pH") + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+ ggtitle("Fixed Acidity Versus pH") + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 5))

# scaled red fixed acidity versus density
rfad = ggplot(scaled_red, aes(x = fixed.acidity, y = density)) + geom_point()+scale_x_continuous(name = "Fixed Acidity") + scale_y_continuous(name = "Density") + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+ ggtitle("Fixed Acidity Versus Density") + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 5))

# scaled red free sulfur dioxide versus total sulfur dioxide
fsdtsd = ggplot(scaled_red, aes(x = free.sulfur.dioxide, y = total.sulfur.dioxide)) + geom_point()+scale_x_continuous(name = "Free Sulfur Dioxide") + scale_y_continuous(name = "Total Sulfur Dioxide") + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+ ggtitle("Free Sulfur Dioxide Versus Total Sulfur Dioxide") + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 5))

ggarrange(rvaca, rfaca, rfap, rfad, fsdtsd, ncol = 3, nrow = 2) %>% annotate_figure(top = text_grob("Red Wine Scaled"))

```

Based on the scatter plots, we can visualize the correlations between the predictors. For example, for white wine, density has a strong positive correlation with residual sugar and a moderate negative correlation with alcohol. Through these scatter plots, we confirm the existence of correlations predicted by our initial correlation matrix and therefore will take these interactions into account for our modeling recipes for white and red wine. 

Now, we can take a look at the box plots for several of our predictors to see the ways that they interact with wine quality, isolated from the other predictors. First, we will visualize acidity levels which can be measured through fixed acidity, volatile acidity, and citric acid levels. As shown above in the scatter plots, these three predictors are highly correlated with each other in red wine. 

```{r eda boxplot of fixed acidity, volatile acidity, and citric acid versus quality, message = FALSE}

#fixed acidity
ggplot(combinedWine, mapping = aes(x = `fixed.acidity`, y = quality, fill = quality)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_point(white_train, mapping = aes(x = alcohol, y = quality)) + labs(title = "Red and White Fixed Acidity Content versus Quality", fill = "Quality")  + scale_fill_brewer(palette="PuRd") + facet_wrap(. ~ type, nrow = 1) +coord_cartesian( xlim = c(0,16), ylim = NULL, default = FALSE )

# volatile acidity 
ggplot(combinedWine, mapping = aes(x = `volatile.acidity`, y = quality, fill = quality)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_point(white_train, mapping = aes(x = alcohol, y = quality)) + labs(title = "Red and White Volatile Acidity Content versus Quality", fill = "Quality")  + scale_fill_brewer(palette="PuRd") + facet_wrap(. ~ type, nrow = 1) + coord_cartesian( xlim = c(0,1), ylim = NULL, default = FALSE )

# citric acid 
ggplot(combinedWine, mapping = aes(x = `citric.acid`, y = quality, fill = quality)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_point(white_train, mapping = aes(x = alcohol, y = quality)) + labs(title = "Red and White Citric Acid Levels Content versus Quality", fill = "Quality")  + scale_fill_brewer(palette="PuRd") + facet_wrap(. ~ type, nrow = 1)+ coord_cartesian( xlim = c(0,1), ylim = NULL, default = FALSE )

```

From these boxp lots, we can see that fixed acidity levels are relatively consistent in both red and white wine. Volatile acidity has a  negative correlation with quality in red wine, but relatively consistent averages for each level of wine quality in white wine. Citric acid levels in red wine have a stronger positive correlation than in white wine. In general, we can see that acidity levels fluctuate more in red wine than in white wine.  

Next, let's take a look at dryness which is determined by the predictor density. Based on the correlation matrix and scatter plots, density also interacts with residual sugar and alcohol in white wine and with fixed acidity in red wine. 

```{r eda box plot density, message=FALSE}
# density
ggplot(combinedWine, mapping = aes(x = density, y = quality, fill = quality)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_point(white_train, mapping = aes(x = density, y = quality)) + labs(title = "Red and White Density Levels versus Quality", fill = "Quality")  + scale_fill_brewer(palette="PuRd") + facet_wrap(. ~ type, nrow = 1)+ coord_cartesian( xlim = c(.985,1.01), ylim = NULL, default = FALSE )
```

Although density is correlated with several predictors according to the correlation matrices and scatter plots, in this box plot, we can see that density stays relatively consistent, around 1, for each level of wine quality. 

Next, we will look at the taste of the wine, which is determined by levels of sweetness and saltiness. These are affected by sugar levels and chlorides respectively. 

```{r eda box plot taste, message=FALSE}
#sugar content
ggplot(combinedWine, mapping = aes(x = residual.sugar, y = quality, fill = quality)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_point(white_train, mapping = aes(x = residual.sugar, y = quality)) + labs(title = "Red and White Residual Sugar Content versus Quality", fill = "Quality")  + scale_fill_brewer(palette="PuRd") + facet_wrap(. ~ type, nrow = 1) + coord_cartesian( xlim = c(0,25), ylim = NULL, default = FALSE )

#chlorides
ggplot(combinedWine, mapping = aes(x = chlorides, y = quality, fill = quality)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_point(white_train, mapping = aes(x = chlorides, y = quality)) + labs(title = "Red and White Chloride Content versus Quality", fill = "Quality")  + scale_fill_brewer(palette="PuRd") + facet_wrap(. ~ type, nrow = 1) + coord_cartesian( xlim = c(0,0.3), ylim = NULL, default = FALSE )
```

White wine has, on average, higher and more variable sugar levels than red wine while red wine has an on average higher chloride content than white wine. There seem to be a higher number of outliers in the values of chloride.

Next, we will analyze alcohol content, which can affect the taste of the wine as well. 

```{r eda box plot alcohol, message=FALSE}
ggplot(combinedWine, mapping = aes(x = alcohol, y = quality, fill = quality)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_point(white_train, mapping = aes(x = alcohol, y = quality)) + labs(title = "Red and White Alcohol Content versus Quality", fill = "Quality")  + scale_fill_brewer(palette="PuRd") + facet_wrap(. ~ type, nrow = 1) 
```

There is generally higher alcohol content associated with a wine of higher quality but there is not a significant different in averages between red wine and white wine. 

Lastly, let's look at the preservative content, which is determined by free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, and sulfates. 

```{r eda box plot preservatives, message=FALSE}
#free sulfur dioxide
ggplot(combinedWine, mapping = aes(x = free.sulfur.dioxide, y = quality, fill = quality)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_point(white_train, mapping = aes(x = free.sulfur.dioxide, y = quality)) + labs(title = "Red and White Free Sulfur Dioxide Content versus Quality", fill = "Quality")  + scale_fill_brewer(palette="PuRd") + facet_wrap(. ~ type, nrow = 1) + coord_cartesian( xlim = c(0,150), ylim = NULL, default = FALSE )

#total sulfur dioxide
ggplot(combinedWine, mapping = aes(x = total.sulfur.dioxide, y = quality, fill = quality)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_point(white_train, mapping = aes(x = total.sulfur.dioxide, y = quality)) + labs(title = "Red and White Total Sulfur Dioxide Content versus Quality", fill = "Quality")  + scale_fill_brewer(palette="PuRd") + facet_wrap(. ~ type, nrow = 1) + coord_cartesian( xlim = c(0,300), ylim = NULL, default = FALSE )

#sulfates
ggplot(combinedWine, mapping = aes(x = sulphates, y = quality, fill = quality)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_point(white_train, mapping = aes(x = sulphates, y = quality)) + labs(title = "Red and White Sulfate Content versus Quality", fill = "Quality")  + scale_fill_brewer(palette="PuRd") + facet_wrap(. ~ type, nrow = 1) + coord_cartesian( xlim = c(0,1.5), ylim = NULL, default = FALSE )

```

From the box plots we can see that red wine generally has a lower sulfur dioxide content than white wine. Also, averages across each stratification of quality have similar values except for sulfates in red wine, which have a slight positive correlation with quality.
