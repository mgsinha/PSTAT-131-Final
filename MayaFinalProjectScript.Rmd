## Overview of Data Set

<br> 

We are analyzing the quality of wine based on 11 predictors: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulfates, alcohol. Quality, in this instance, is defined as an indicator of its craftsmanship and, thus, desirability which can be used, for example, in pricing. Quality does not necessarily indicate if a wine has gone bad. We will use two data sets -- one for white wine and the other for red -- to create two respective machine learning models. There are 4899 observations in the white wine data set and 1600 observations in the red wine data set. 


## Overview of Research Questions 

<br>

We are interested in conducting analysis on both the white and red wine to assess the quality of wine in new wines in production so that they may be accurately priced and marketed.  

## Proposed Project Timeline

# Loading Data and Packages 
This project uses data on the white and red wine, which records information about the details of the wine. 

```{r load packages and data}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(tidymodels)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)

white <- read.csv("Wine Dataset/winequality-white.csv", sep = ";")

red <- read.csv("Wine Dataset/winequality-red.csv", sep = ";")

# Make Column Names Clean 
white %>% clean_names()
red %>% clean_names()

# Change quality to factor
white$quality <- factor(white$quality, levels = c(3,4,5,6,7,8,9))
red$quality <- factor(red$quality, levels = c(3,4,5,6,7,8,9))

# Adding type
white$type <- "White"
red$type <- "Red"

# data frame of combined wine
combinedWine <- rbind(white, red)

white

red
```


# Data Cleaning 

Our data does not need to be cleaned because it's perfect :D

# Data Split

```{r data split}
white_split <- white %>% 
  initial_split(prop = 0.8, strata = "quality")

white_train <- training(white_split)
white_test <- testing(white_split)

red_split <- red %>% 
  initial_split(prop = 0.8, strata = "quality")

red_train <- training(red_split)
red_test <- testing(red_split)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

What sort of factors do winemakers and sommeliers look for in a quality wine? Generally, quality is determined by acidity, dryness, flavor profile or taste, alcohol content, and how well the wine is preserved or how it changes as it is stored. In our exploratory data analysis, we will analyze our predictors based on these five categories. First, acidity levels can be summarized through the pH levels, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, and citric acid content. Dryness is determined by the density. Taste can be broken down into sweetness and saltiness, which are caused by residual sugar and chlorides respectively. We will analyze alcohol content singularly to see its effect on the wine quality. Lastly, sulfurous compounds are what is generally used to preserve wine, so we will analyze free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, and sulfates to see if the way a wine is preserved interacts with wine quality in an interesting way.

Our data can be split into two datasets because experts look for different levels of acidity, sugar, etc. for white wine and red wine. Thus, we will have 3 different representations of the data: one for white wine, one for red wine, and one for both. 

All of our predictors are continuous, so we will use boxplots, histograms, and scatterplots to visualize our data and determine how to approach feature selection.  


```{r correlation matrix}
white %>% 
  select(is.numeric) %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  corrplot(type = 'lower', diag = FALSE,

red %>% 
  select(is.numeric) %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  corrplot(type = 'lower', diag = FALSE, 
           method = 'color', main = 'Red Wine Correlation Plot')
```

## Model Fitting

Based on the correlations between predictors, we interacted those terms in our recipe. The terms we interact are different for white wine and red wine. We also excluded fixed acidity from our recipe because in the boxplot, we can see that the amount of fixed acidity has little effect on the quality of the wine for both white and red wine. 

```{r recipe}
white_recipe <- recipe(quality ~ volatile.acidity + citric.acid + residual.sugar + chlorides + free.sulfur.dioxide + total.sulfur.dioxide + density + pH + sulphates + alcohol, data = white_train) %>% step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% step_interact(~density:residual.sugar + density:alcohol) %>% step_normalize(all_predictors())

red_recipe <- recipe(quality ~ volatile.acidity + citric.acid + residual.sugar + chlorides + free.sulfur.dioxide + total.sulfur.dioxide + density + pH + sulphates + alcohol, data = red_train) %>% step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% step_interact(~citric.acid:fixed.acidity + density:fixed.acidity + ph:fixed.acidity + citric.acid:volatile.acidity + free.sulfur.dioxide:total.sulfur.dioxide)%>% step_normalize(all_predictors())
